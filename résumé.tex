\subtitle{Work Experience}
\table{#\quad\hfil\cr}{
	\bf Lockheed Martin \hfill May 2016 --- August 2016\cr
	Contributed to a JavaFX Internal Research and Development\cr
	project, helping to design custom controls as well as full\cr
	implementation of many panels. This has taught me to use\cr
	software development tools such as TestFX and Gradle. Code\cr
	review and the tooling used for this job helped me improve my\cr
	programming skills, while giving me a look into development in an\cr
	enterprise.\\

\subtitle{Programming Experience}
\table{#\quad\hfil\cr}{
	\bf Personal Project \hfill September 2016 --- Present\cr
	Working on implementing a simple freestanding C Kernel for a\cr
	real-time operating system on the x86 and ARM architectures.\cr
	Current implementation handles simple scheduling, and very\cr
	limited threading support.\\
%
	\bf Personal Project \hfill September 2015 --- October 2015\cr
	Designed and programmed a multi-purpose WebRTC chat\cr
	application capable of recording audio and video, as well as doing\cr
	some simple real-time effect rendering.\\
%
	\bf Personal Project \hfill June 2015 --- August 2015\cr
	Wrote a simple Unix shell using Golang, learning how to make\cr
	system calls, how to handle child processes with the standard\cr
	Golang library, and how to implement many Unix commands.\\
%
	\bf Personal Project \hfill January 2015 --- March 2015\cr
	Designed and implemented a multi-threaded low-latency playback\cr
	loop for sound cards with separate input and output plugs using\cr
	the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture API in C, efficient enough\cr
	to run on low end hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. This\cr
	program was capable of doing simple Fourier transforms on the\cr
	sound data to generate sound effects for guitar sound input.\\
